# Tomoya Eguchi (Cumuloworks)

## Director / Motion Designer / CG Generalist

I am a freelance director, motion designer, and CG generalist based in Tokyo, Japan.

I began my journey in video production as a teenager and have since built a successful career, which includes 2.5 years at Naname, Inc.

In 2021, I transitioned my freelance business into a corporation named Cumuloworks, Inc., and I continue to expand my production horizons.

With years of experience in the Japanese video production industry, my team and I are capable of producing a wide variety of motion graphics and CGI using various techniques.
