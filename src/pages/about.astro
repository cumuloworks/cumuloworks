                <p>
                    I am a freelance director, motion designer, and CG
                    generalist based in Tokyo, Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started creating videos in high school and began
                    commercial video production after entering university.

                <p>

                        >Naname Inc.</a
                    >. After gaining two and a half years of experience, I
                    became a freelancer.
